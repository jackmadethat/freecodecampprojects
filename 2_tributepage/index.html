<p>Challenge ProMode Arena (CPMA) is a competitive modification for the PC first-person shooter Quake 3: Arena that was first developed in 1999 as an attempt to advance Quake as a competitive sport. Quake, and it's multiplayer modification QuakeWorld, had already seen considerable success as a competitive game and a spectator sport at this time, so an evolution of the platform following huge technological progress was only natural.</p>

<p class="quote"><blockquote><i>If there were a small set of professional rules that I agree with in theory but have chosen not to pursue because they conflict with more common play, then an official "pro mode" might make sense.</i>
 - â€ŠJohn Carmack 1999</blockquote></p>

<h2>Origin</h2>
<p>CPMA raises the skill ceiling of vanilla Quake 3 (VQ3) in a number of significant ways. Instant weapon switching, a new collection of arenas, 125fps gameplay, and several new game modes are among only a few. Enhanced netcode, in particular, allowed for more balanced and fair gameplay for players across great distances such as east and west USA, and players with strong and weak connections. Most significantly, CPMA saw the return and expansion of a physics model that more closely related to that of QuakeWorld (QW). The altered physics allowed for more complex movement patterns, better control during jumps, and a generally more enhanced style of movement for the player.</p>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>
<p>CPMA was designed to represent the highest-end of competitive gaming. A strong focus on the 1-vs-1 or 'duel' format exemplifies this belief. The game became very 'champion' oriented, with big names like Apheleon, rat, Vo0 and griffin becoming well-known in the broader gaming scene. These guys played the most challenging and competitive game ever designed at the highest possible level. In an authentic way, CPMA was the 'Formula One' of e-sports.</p>

<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>Today, the playerbase of CPMA is small. The era of Quake is long over, but the legacy of CPMA remains in the form of a loyal, dedicated and highly skilled community of players that organise in public chatrooms such as discord, rather than by lurking in a server browser. Even development continues, with new and updated technology such as raytracing and high-polygon models being added to the base game on an infrequent, but consistent basis. Even the arenas are gradually updated and modernised. Will CPMA or a game like it see the same kind of infamy of the early millennium? Time will tell. The Arena Shooter genre may be out of vogue in the 2020s', but masterpieces never go out of style.</p>
