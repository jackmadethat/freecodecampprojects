<p>Learning to duel (1v1) in Quake 3's competitive mod, CPMA, represents the upper echelons of pro gaming. Let's dig into the fundamentals to see what it takes to dominate...</p>

<p>First, the game prep. Make sure you have your core weapons bound to the keys around your movement - if you move with WASD, put your rocket launcher (RL), railgun (RG) and lightning gun (LG) on keys like Q, E, R, F, C, X, V, 3 or 4. </p>

<p>Beyond this, you'll want to learn the fundamentals of bunny-hopping and circle-jumping. These movement techniques involve manipulating the game's physics system to jump further and faster than is ordinarily possible.</p>

<p>Thirdly, a good working knowledge of the most-played competitive maps is critical to understanding the flow of each game, from the item and weapon locations to the quickest routes between key locations. These maps include:</p>

<code>cpm1a, cpm3a, cpm22, cpm24, pro-q3dm6, pro-q3tourney4 and pukka3tourney2</code>

<header class="section-header" id="mapcontrol">Map Control</header>

<p>As mentioned, knowing the map you're playing on is crucial. You need to practice moving between the high-priority items as quickly as possible and learning every pathway around the map.</p>

<p>Your high priority items are the red armor (RA) and mega health (MH). The RA spawns on the map every 25s after pickup, but the MH spawns 20s after the health of the last person to pick it up drops below 100.</p>

<code>At the start of a match, consider where you've spawned and where your opponent is likely to spawn. It's not always the best move to grab health or armor over a strong weapon.</code>

<p>Yellow armor (YA), green armor (GA) and normal health pickups all spawn 30s after pickup. Work on using your intuition to learn when these items are picked up, learn the sound cues that indicate when an item has been taken, and work on predicting what your opponent's health and armor (their 'stack') looks like. A high health, high armor opponent will be aggressive and durable, so be careful and don't be afraid to retreat if you're vulnerable.</p>

<p>When you have a good stack (over 100/100) and at least one strong weapon, you can start looking for a fight. Until you're ready, it's usually best to retreat and keep a safe distance from your opponent. The only exception to this is if it's late in the match and you're down a frag or two, you may need to take a risk to get the upper hand. Until then, prioritize your items and movements like this:</p>
<ul>
  <li>RA/MH. If these are taken, grab shards and bubbles and avoid being damaged.</li>
  <li>RL/RG/LG. If these are taken, plasma gun (PG), grenade launcher (GL) and shotgun (SG) are next, depending on availability and preference.</li>
  <li>If your stack is low, keep your opponent far away. If your stack is high, close distance with your opponent and be aggressive.</li>
  <li>Cover high-priority items and set traps for your opponent. Use sound cues to anticipate your opponent's location, and use area denial weapons (like GL) to control their movement.</li>
  <li>Not being fragged is always preferable to being fragged. CPMA games are only ten minutes long, so if you're ahead, play to the advantage by avoiding fights and maintaining control.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the short timespan of a CPMA match (only ten minutes), carefully divide your priorities between scoring frags and keeping your stack high so that you can maintain dominance and control over the arena.</p>
<code>If you're struggling to get ahead or string together frags (and your aim is good) then consider that you're playing too aggressively or being aggressive when you shouldn't. Be sure to review your losses from your opponent's perspective!</code>

<p>The two main categories of Quake ability are movement and weapon handling. You need to be faster and more agile than your opponent, and you need to be able to shoot straighter than they do.</p>
<code>Improve your movement with training maps like b0_beta6 and by practicing moving around maps.</code>
<p>One of the best ways to improve your game is by... Playing the game! More specifically, review your match demos both from your perspective and your opponent's, as mentioned above. This gives you key insight into what it's like to play against you, and can highlight weak areas in your playstyle.</p>
<code>Improve your aim by turning on god mode and playing against several high level CPM bots, as they move quickly and unpredictably.</code>
<p>You can also use console commands to decrease the timescale of the game, which has the effect of making the game seem to be in fast-forward. Train against bots this way, and then your regular games will feel like slow-motion!</p>

<p>CPMA is one of the most gratifying games to play, and is a frantic and exciting spectacle to watch. Arguably, nobody has gained enough skill or has had enough talent to truly push the level of gameplay to it's absolute limit. CPMA is, truly, as close to a genuine Martial Art that video gaming has ever achieved.</p>
<p>With the discipline and ability of a Shaolin Monk, the speed and ferocity of an MMA fighter, and the nerve and killer instinct of a Formula One driver, you may rise to the heights of such legends as Apheleon, Griffin, Vo0 and rat. gg, and hf.</p>
